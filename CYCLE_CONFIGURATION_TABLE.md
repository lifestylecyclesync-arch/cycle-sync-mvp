## Key Misalignments & Why They Matter

| Issue | Days | Why | Solution |
|-------|------|-----|----------|
| Follicular splits into 2 fasting phases | 6-12 | Power ends at day 10; Manifestation starts day 11 | Days 1-10 Power, Days 11-15 Manifestation |
| Early Luteal splits into 2 fasting phases | 16-20 | Power ends at day 19; Nurture starts day 20 | Days 16-19 Power, Days 20-28 Nurture |
| Ovulation aligns with Manifestation | 13-15 | Peak metabolism matches peak fasting window ✅ | No split needed |
| Menstrual aligns with Power | 1-5 | Low energy but body can fast for recovery | No split needed |

## Updated Phase Breakdown

To perfectly align with Dr. Mindy Pelz's framework, we might need to create **6 sub-phases**:

1. **Menstrual + Power** (Days 1-5)
2. **Follicular + Power** (Days 6-10)
3. **Follicular + Manifestation** (Days 11-12)
4. **Ovulation + Manifestation** (Days 13-15)
5. **Early Luteal + Power** (Days 16-19)
6. **Luteal + Nurture** (Days 20-28)

This would ensure **fasting recommendations change exactly when the fasting phase changes**, providing the most accurate day-by-day guidance.
